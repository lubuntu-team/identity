## ABOUT THIS MANUAL

This **Lubuntu Corporate Identity Manual** contains the rules and guidelines as they relate to the correct visual portrayal of **Lubuntu** as a Brand. There are guidelines for the official colours, fonts (typefaces), as well as other visual iconography, and how they may be merged into acceptable documents or communications. Please do not use this manual to replicate artwork. Original digital artwork will be available on the website. We are not in a position to supply artwork in other format unless it is specifically required for paid for productions, or advertising. The logo may not be used if it does not conform to these guidelines.

If you have any queries please contact the **Lubuntu** teams:

* [Lubuntu Team](https://launchpad.net/~lubuntu-admins)
* [Lubuntu Artwork Team](https://launchpad.net/~lubuntu-art)

Please note that these pages were printed on a laser printer and colours are not 100% accurate. Also non-calibrated monitors will not be able to represent true colours unless ICC / ICM profiles are set up.

##  THE LOGO

For the sake of legibility, the logo must never use uppercase letters at all. The font used must always be the Ubuntu Font Family. The roundel is a key component of branding in the Ubuntu Family.
